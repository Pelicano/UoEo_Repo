#Model Definition

This is a Python code that defines a StrideModel class and a Threat class. StrideModel is used to analyze potential security threats in a system based on the STRIDE model (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege). The class contains various methods to analyze the different types of security threats and add them to a list of Threat objects. The Threat class is used to store information about each detected threat, including the type and description.

The code begins by importing the logging, re, hashlib, and datetime modules. The Threat class is defined first and contains a constructor that initializes the threat type and description attributes. The StrideModel class is then defined and contains a constructor that initializes the system name attribute and creates an empty list to store the detected threats. It also sets up logging to write messages to a file named "security.log".

The StrideModel class contains various methods to analyze the different types of security threats based on the STRIDE model. For example, the analyze_spoofing method checks if user input contains non-alphanumeric characters, and if so, it calls the add_threat method to add a Spoofing threat to the list of detected threats. Similarly, the analyze_tampering method checks if the request data is not empty and if it contains non-alphanumeric characters, and if so, it adds a Tampering threat to the list of detected threats.

The authenticate_user method is used to authenticate a user based on their username and password. It hashes the password using the SHA-256 algorithm and compares it to a precomputed hash value for the admin user. If the authentication is successful, it logs a message and returns True. Otherwise, it logs a warning and returns False.

#Example Usage In Code

The code then creates a new StrideModel object named "My System" and calls various methods to analyze different types of security threats. For example, it calls the analyze_spoofing method with some user input, which adds a Spoofing threat to the list of detected threats if it contains non-alphanumeric characters. It then calls the analyze_tampering method with some request data, which adds a Tampering threat to the list of detected threats if it is not empty and contains non-alphanumeric characters. The code also calls the authenticate_user method to authenticate a user and performs some actions based on the result.

Finally, the code calls the get_threats method to retrieve all detected threats and prints them to the console. It also calls the get_threats method with a specific threat type to retrieve all detected Tampering threats and prints them to the console.

To run the code ctrl+shift+t to open the terminal.
Type `python stride.py` and press Enter.

From the example usage, all threats identified are mapped onto the security.log file with relevant timestamps. Terminal output should be as follows:

//load the terminal_output.png

The security.log file should be as follows: 

//load security_log.png
